# Food-Friend

Welcome to this Sustainability Project. I aim to improve sustainability through preventing food wastage, all through an easy to use Google Home Interface! or Alexa in general.

Have you ever had produce in your fridge, but didn't know when it would go bad? Look no further than Food Buddy, your neighborly fridge assistant! Its a system integrated in your Google Home that keeps track of the food you have and tells you specifically about its spoilage information. You can tell your Food Buddy your entire refrigerator inventory and it will keep track of what's still good and what's bad. Use it, and say goodbye to those guilty grocery trips today!
